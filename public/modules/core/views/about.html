	    <h2 class="about-title">Feeling</h2>
	    <p class="about-paragraph">I consider myself to be a combination between a perfectionist, analyst and organizer. I often give too much attention to details. This results in overwork, but I do like a challenge. Challenges are based on problems and problems are always where I begin. As a designer I believe that the foundation of every project is a well defined problem. As a programmer I know every problem can be solved and my aim is to do it in an efficient way. There is no innovation if it doesn’t solve a problem, no creativity if it doesn’t find an original solution to do so.</p>

      <h2 class="about-title">Purpose</h2>
      <p class="about-paragraph">It often happens that I just know my ideas are right. Think about it. It happens to all of us. If you have to take a decision that will influence your business or career, you just feel it is the right one. This feeling will come sooner or later, you just have to listen to it.</p>

      <h2 class="about-title">Love</h2>
      <p class="about-paragraph">I very rarely find design that has a mind-boggling grab of my visual senses. We all fall in love. Some are able to just fall in love with people, some with objects, and some with both. I fall in love with design.</p>
