				<h3 class="normal-title second-title">Introduction</h3>
				<p class="default-paragraph">
					Vink is a custom blog system, run in Aarhus and Copenhagen by board members with a background in journalism. I was solicited to develop an application that covered needs for location, venue presentation, image galleries and event display. The biggest challenges in this project were to develop an intuitive system that performed as good as popular blogging platforms (such as WordPress), but without the overwhelming amount of functionality that wasn't required.  
				</p>
				<h3 class="normal-title second-title">The process</h3>
				<p class="default-paragraph">
				The project foundations were put in March 2013, starting with the Aarhus branch. Just over a year, Vink Copenhagen was also launched in April 2014. 
				The first steps were to communicate closely with the client and understand the brand behind the platform. Next, ideas where debated and together with the entire board, desired features where agreed upon. Wireframes where exposed to many iterations that resulted into accurate mock-ups covering resolutions for both desktops and mobile devices. The mock-ups where deeply inspired by Vinkâ€™s identity and core values, in relation to the already existing brand assets. Afterwards, the database architecture was created, followed by the back-end and finally completing the process with the front-end. Many iterations have uncovered new functionality and improved work-flow of both areas of the platform.</p>

			<h3 class="normal-title second-title">The back-end</h3>
			<section class="default-paragraph with-images">
				<p class="default-paragraph">The purpose of the back-end is to be an intuitive environment which can be easily learned by new members (guest members). It offers suggestions to help the novice and functionality to aid the expert. Moreover, Vink identity elements are used in order to stage an emotional design. It is generally packed with the brand values, which new writers can recognize and envelop. The goal is to make the writers feel as being part of something 'bigger', while offering a system that they find natural.</p>
				
				<p class="default-paragraph">
				The login screen is the first interaction with the brand, the logo being visible during and after typing the login information. The logo moves up while loading, being present until all the data is ready. The platform provides two user leves: administrators and registered users.</p>

				</section>

				<p class="default-paragraph">The first user account type (registered users) loads by warmly welcoming the user to a familiarly-colored interface. A basic control panel offering quick access to the platform's essential sections is presented.</p>
				<section class="zoom-image enlargableImage">
					<img alt="Vink" src="../img/projects/vink/vink2.png" class="regular-image"/>
				</section>
				<p class="default-paragraph">One particularity of the dashboard is that messages may be prompted at the top of the page. These messages can be of different types: warnings, alerts or simple notifications. During the launched beta versions, this feature came in handy to track progress and notify the writers of changes in the system.</p>
				<section class="zoom-image enlargableImage">
					<img alt="Vink" src="../img/projects/vink/vink3.png" class="regular-image"/>
				</section>
				<p class="default-paragraph">Adding an article is always a click of a button away. The user is prompted with a category choice, which will ensure that the right category is chosen beforehand.</p>
				<section class="zoom-image enlargableImage">
					<img alt="Vink" src="../img/projects/vink/vink4.png" class="regular-image"/>
				</section>
				<p class="default-paragraph">After selecting a category, the user is taken to the article editor. A custom-made WYSIWYG text editor which basic functionality embedded. If accessed from the main screen, the text editor is in draft mode - meaning that users create article draft that they will later publish.</p>
				<section class="zoom-image enlargableImage">
					<img alt="Vink" src="../img/projects/vink/vink5.png" class="regular-image"/>
				</section>
				<p class="default-paragraph">The size of the text field matches the size of the article on the front-end. Details are carefully added in order to make the experience as smooth and personal as possible. From the 'x' (close) button (it is built from the Vink logo) to video or link pop-ups, everything is crafted consistently.</p>
				<section class="zoom-image enlargableImage">

				</section>
				<p class="default-paragraph">Autosave functions are being implemented on field 'blurs' and triggered every 20 seconds to prevent the loss of data.</p>
				<p class="default-paragraph">
					Moving away from the 'registered' user level account, the administrator presents more options, which represent higher-level control of the system.</p>
				<section class="zoom-image enlargableImage">
					<img alt="Vink" src="../img/projects/vink/vink7.png" class="regular-image"/>
				</section>
				<p class="default-paragraph">Each element of the CMS can be edited here, starting from icons (category icons), categories, users, events, venues or articles. Other features, such as pages are subject of further iterations (grayed-out).</p>
				<section class="zoom-image enlargableImage">
					<img alt="Vink" src="../img/projects/vink/vink8.png" class="regular-image"/>
				</section>
				<p class="default-paragraph">Similar to the registered users, the administrators see a notification area at the top of the page. For development purposes, admins can see a "to-do" list of the remaining tasks.</p>
				<section class="zoom-image enlargableImage">
					<img alt="Vink" src="../img/projects/vink/vink9.png" class="regular-image"/>
				</section>
				<p class="default-paragraph">As part of the custom features, both admin and registered users are allowed to add a 'place' (steder, venue) that is part of neither articles or custom pages. The 'venue' is a custom template for content that offers quick information about a certain place. Venues are shown along the right side of most front-end pages. 
				</p>
				<p class="default-paragraph">
				The add 'user' is crafted in a similar manner, as you can see bellow:

				<p class="default-paragraph">Inside the admin article edtitor, more control is given. For example, the author of the article can be switched.</p>
				<p class="default-paragraph">Other features of the back-end are displayed bellow, such as the icon or category manager. It is worth noting that categories (which make for the front-end main navigation) are sortable via drag and drop, similar to the images inside an article.</p>

				<p class="default-paragraph">The back-end evolved into a mature platform enables the same control on mobile devices, mostly due to the fact that is built on a grid system.</p>

			<section class="default-paragraph with-images">
				<p class="default-paragraph">The final front-end homepage is illustrated bellow in comparison with the design mock-up (wide-screen, 1080p). The mock-up was carefully translated into a responsive front-end solution that similar to the back-end, is full of Vink's personality.

				<p class="default-paragraph">Detailed mock-up representations were a valued process in the project. Because of the mock-up accuracy, the programming of the front-end environment became a delightful task.
