				<h3 class="normal-title second-title">Introduction</h3>
				<p class="default-paragraph">
					EasyTV is a small search engine that based on selected user preferences, provides the best fitting TV packages in a certain location. Together with a responsive front-end search interface, the system requires a capable back-end for package management, locations or even individual channels. 
				</p>

				<h3 class="normal-title second-title">The process</h3>
				<p class="default-paragraph">
					The project sets off with quick prototyping of the front and back-end. For the back-end, the <a href="../img/projects/easytv/db.png" class="default-link" targe="_blank">database architecture</a> and <a href="../img/projects/easytv/uml.png" class="default-link" targe="_blank">class diagram</a> are created. For the front-end, the client identity is consolidated and adapted to the application vision. Next, the project follows a falsificationist philosophy by testing each decision and iterating until it passes the tests. Prototypes are made for each iteration.

				<h3 class="normal-title second-title">Front-end</h3>
				<p class="default-paragraph">
				The design of EasyTV balances two stylistic categories: usability functionalism and digital modernism. The aim was to find a middle point between an appealing and a functional interface. A mobile first development pattern was followed for concept creation.
				</p>

				</section>
				<p class="default-paragraph">
				The approach on the search options was by the last iteration changed to an interface that resembles a complex filter. Channels are selectable from a list and the search functionality is reserved as an alternative option.
				The channel list is dynamically changed based on the application usage (for example, channels that are on average selected the most will appear at the top of the list).
				</p>
				<p class="default-paragraph">
				Selecting a channel from the list and category colors in a mid iteration prototype:

				<p class="default-paragraph">
				Colorfulness and visual complexity impact the user's first impression on the applicationâ€™s design, which is happens subsonsciously. The first impression may prove decisive when the users experience the smallest difficulty and frustration (the user overlooks small problems). The final iteration maintains the bold brand feel and message, for it is there to enhance usability by highlighting not only user interface elements, but areas of controls.

				<p class="default-paragraph">
				Interface elements of the user interface are consistent in style, shape and feel. Elements with the same function have the same color and by reducing the number of objects, object sizes and placing them symmetrically, the composition becomes balanced and pleasant. These measured and the high level of symmetry will result in a significant impact when it comes to the perceived visual esthetics, which ultimately will boost the application credibility.

				The grid on which interface elements are symmetrically placed:

				<h3 class="normal-title second-title">Progressive enhancement</h3>
				<p class="default-paragraph">
				By going up in screen sizes, new filtering options are added to the interface, that make full use of the larger canvas.
				</p>

				<p class="default-paragraph">
				For example, at the following screen size category filters are permanently shown on the right side, while multiple columns of channels are displayed.
				Medium display size (possibly tablet):

				</section>

				<p class="default-paragraph">
				Furthermore, screens of an even larger canvas size display expanded filtering options.
				Example of a large display layout (possibly laptop or desktop):

				<p class="default-paragraph">
				The search benefits from the same enhancement displaying expanded filters on the right side of the layout.
				Example of search enhancement:

				<p class="default-paragraph">
				The area reserved for selected channel filters gains more space and columns, offering overview and control.

				<p class="default-paragraph">
				Finally, search results are consistent with the previous enhancements by also providing additional filters on the right side of the layout.

				The last iteration is focusing on designing a user interface that does not come before content. It is not noticeable while interacting with it, it doesn't get in the user's way. It is honest and involves not only functional, but also psychological and aesthetic criteria which empower the users while delighting them. 
				</p>

				<p class="default-paragraph">
				Lastly, here are a few comparisons between one of the very first, middle point iteration and final iterations:

				The challenge behind this project was to create a balanced responsive interface that allows searching for TV packages based on various filters. The front-end interface may be managed by a corresponding back-end, not presented on this page. The final design was achieved by testing each design decision and changing the interface accordingly.
